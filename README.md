A Book Recommendation System is a data-driven application designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences, reading history, and behaviour. It employs various data science and machine learning techniques to provide personalized book recommendations, enhancing the reading experience for users. If you want to learn how to build a Book Recommendation System, this article is for you. In this article, Iâ€™ll take you through the task of building a Book Recommendation System using Python.


Book Recommendation System: Process We Can Follow
Building a book recommendation system requires a combination of data processing, machine learning expertise, and a deep understanding of user preferences. Below are the steps you can follow to build a Book Recommendation System:

Collect a comprehensive dataset of books, including information like titles, authors, genres, summaries, and user ratings. Additionally, collect user data, such as reading history, reviews, and ratings.
Clean and preprocess the collected data.
Conduct EDA to identify popular genres, highly-rated books, and user reading patterns.
Choose recommendation algorithms that suit the dataset and user requirements.
Train the selected recommendation model using the preprocessed data to build a model that can predict user preferences and generate personalized book recommendations.
So, the process begins with collecting a dataset based on book information. I found an ideal dataset for this task. You can download the dataset from here.
